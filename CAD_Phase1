Hosting Static Websites on IBM Cloud:

This blog post explains how to host a static website on IBM Cloud. These websites are rendered client-side by the browser from static assets, like HTML, CSS and JS files. They do not need a server-side component to create pages dynamically at runtime. Static websites are often combined with backend APIs to create Single Page Applications.

Hosting static websites on IBM Cloud uses Cloud Object Storage (COS) and Cloud Internet Services (CIS) (with Page Rules and Edge Functions). 

Serving static assets:

IBM Cloud Object Storage is a scalable storage solution for cloud applications. Files are managed through a RESTful HTTP API and stored in user-defined collections called “buckets”. Bucket files are returned as HTTP responses from HTTP GET requests.

COS supports an optional “anonymous read-only access” setting for buckets. This means all files in the bucket will be accessible using anonymous HTTP GET requests.


Putting HTML, CSS and JS files in a public bucket allows static websites to be served directly by COS. Users are charged for bandwidth used and HTTP requests received for all bucket files.

Steps to setup our personal blogs:

Create your account:

First, create an account by using your existing IBMid or a new IBMid. If your company is registered to use a federated ID for single sign-on (SSO), you can use your federated ID instead.
Login ID
Details
Existing IBMid
If you already have an IBMid, sign up for IBM Cloud with your existing credentials that you use for other IBM® products and services.
New IBMid
If you don't yet have an IBMid, you can create one when you sign up. With an IBMid, you can use one username to log in to all IBM products and services, including IBM Cloud.
Federated ID
If your company already requested to register the user credentials from your company's domain with IBM, you can sign up for IBM Cloud by using the credentials that you already use for your company's login. You must enter a phone number when you sign up.

Table 1. ID options for creating an account
Using your IBMid
If you're not a part of a company that uses a federated ID, use your IBMid to create your account.
Go to the IBM Cloud login page , and click Create an IBM Cloud account.
Enter your IBMid email address. If you don't have an existing IBMid, an ID is created based on the email that you enter.
Complete the remaining fields with your information.
Note: You are prompted for your credit card information to verify your identity and secure your account. You can try out IBM Cloud for free and only pay for billable services that you choose to use, with no long-term contracts or commitments.
Click Create account.
Confirm your account by clicking the link in the confirmation email that is sent to your provided email address.
Using a federated ID
A federated ID is an ID within a company's domain that is registered with IBM so that the domain and user credentials can be used to access IBM web applications. You can sign up for IBM Cloud with a federated ID only if your company is already registered with IBM. Registering a company's domain with IBM enables users to log in to IBM products and services by using their existing company user credentials. Authentication is then handled by your company's identity provider (IdP) through single sign-on (SSO).
IBM uses the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) for this identity federation. SAML 2.0 is a standard version for exchanging authentication data between security domains. It's an XML-based protocol that uses a security token that contains assertions to pass information between the organizations IdP, and the IBM Rely Party (RP), otherwise known as the Service Provider.
For information about how to register your company for a federated ID, see the IBMid Enterprise Federation Adoption Guide . An IBM sponsor, such as an offering advocate or client advocate, is required when you request to register federated IDs.
Upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account
If you have a Lite account, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account to access the full IBM Cloud catalog.
Click Manage > Account.
Select Account settings, and click Add credit card.
Enter your credit card information.
Set up account MFA settings
By default, users in your account verify themselves by logging in with a username and password. To require users to use more secure authentication factors, complete the following steps to set up multifactor authentication (MFA).
Important: Setting up MFA in your account affects all members of the account. This means that if users of your account are members of multiple IBM Cloud accounts, they must enroll for MFA at their next login even if they don't intend to use resources in the secured account.
Go to Manage > Access (IAM), and select Settings.
Update the current authentication setting by clicking Edit in the Authentication section.
Select the type of MFA to enable in your account.
MFA for users with an IBMid: Require users to authenticate by using an IBMid, password, and time-based one-time passcode (TOTP). You can enable this option for all users or nonfederated users.
MFA for all users (IBMid & supported IdPs): Require users to authenticate by using one of the following MFA factors. This option applies to users who are using either an IBMid or an external IdP.
Email-based MFA: Users authenticate by using a security passcode that is sent through email.
TOTP MFA: Users authenticate by using a time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) with an authenticator app, such as IBM Security Verify or Google Authenticator.
U2F MFA: Users authenticate by using a hardware security key that generates a six-digit numerical code. This factor offers the highest level of security.
Click Update.
Note: The first time that you log in to your account after updating your MFA settings, you need to verify your identity by using two different verification methods. Methods for verification include email, text, or phone call, and you can use any combination of those options to verify your identity. After you verify your identity, you set up and provide details for your authentication factor.
Estimate your costs
Complete the following steps to get an estimate of how much your usage might cost:
Go to the catalog , and select Type > Services.
Select a service that you're interested in.
